As a Braincels user who is closer to 40 than 30, doesn't hate women or advocate suicide, the collegiality of the incel subs is what I miss the most. There just isn't anywhere else you can vent with a bunch of guys who (by and large) get it. If this place looks too much like condescension or a vehicle for control freaks with a saviour complex the offer won't be taken up.  Most incel sub users seem to be in their teens and 20s and their grief is pretty raw sometimes. But then you only have to browse IT briefly to see that there are a lot of immature children with big problems of their own, howling into the void there too."

Sex is a component to many different things. Relationships, An industry, a need for when you and your comrades got stuck up in a mountain with no heat, and sometimes just people validating themselves for selfish reasons, in certain clubs of polygamy its basically another word for hello.

I got my first taste of a real party in the 11th grade at a class gathering. And I didn't even get into the club cause I forgot my ID. I only occasionally went out with them for the other year and a half until graduation, but I was slowly coming out of my shell.  After being in university for a year already and having gone out maybe 5 times in total, I ran into a classmate on the street. We talked for about 5 minutes, see how the other one was doing, and he mentioned something about a night falling apart cause he couldn't get enough people to go out. So I just told him to count me in if he ever needed more bodies around a table. He took my new phone number, and invited me out to a bar three days later.   I've been going out with a bunch of friends almost weekly ever since. And that's really the best thing you can do as a first step. You insert yourself in social situations like the club or a bar with some friends, you start getting comfortable in those settings, and at some point you will be drunk and confident enough to just talk to a girl naturally. Especially if there are ladies in your company already.   I myself can't offer much advice for after you start dating, cause I haven't dated myself. I've stuck to the casual game. Although if you have a high libido I wouldn't recommend hook-ups, since any niche fetishes you might have will never see fruition."
