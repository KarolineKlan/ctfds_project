Incels already put an inordinate amount of attention on being in a relationship and having that become a primary purpose of their life. The idea of coping reinforces this because it makes it so that anything outside of that stated goal is secondary to living your life. Your hobbies don't exist for the sake of existing they are there to provide solace which is an unhealthy way to look at them. it takes one of the worst aspects of inceldom which is its fixation and basically creates a focal point where anything outside of it is a means to an end.  In actual psychology a coping mechanism is not a bad thing because it is a soothing behavior that being said they are still things that need to be carefully monitored so they don't turn into avoidant behavior. incels on the other hand seem to exist on the opposite end of the spectrum where they avoid coping mechanisms so much that it just reinforces that obsessive behavior that does not tolerate anything that might actually benefit them unless it is the stated goal itself.  the long and short let your hobbies be hobbies and don't call them copes because that is an unhealthy way to look at things that you enjoy and devalues you as a person. if it is a legitimate coping mechanism and you use it as such that is fine but understand that the a term is normally just abused within blackpill spaces.",

         "But aren't you saying the same thing by saying that you not only understand what they go through but you can comparably measure it versus yourself. Even if we did take Jeff bezos in this argument it still wouldn't mean that his pain is any less than yours it just means you don't want to listen to him which is fine but it also means that communication can't happen and well that's not a big deal for a billionaire it is kind of a problem when it is a decent portion of the population. At the end of the day you're still invalidating other people's feelings by comparing it to your own there is literally a term for this \"Trauma Olympics\".  The whole point of it is that no one actually climbs up because everyone is too busy tearing down each other and being defensive in order to see the larger point continuing to commit both logical fallacies and  voids of empathy because it helps further the point that validates their own pain at the expense of others. The statement wasn't that your pain isn't valid the statement was that there are other kinds of pains that are also felt across the aisle. That is actually a beginning of empathy to compare two things to try and understand where the point of commonality begins as long as it isn't done in a way that invalidates the other side. But again both egos and defensive walls that we have constructed due to trauma interfere with that connection it does feel very invalidating when somebody else says they suffer in response to you saying you suffer but that doesn't necessarily mean that's the truth.  I propose that these three statements are equally true as a conclusion to this \"debate\".  1. There is validity in suffering due to a feeling of objectification and lacking intimacy despite intercourse.  2. There's a validity in suffering due to a lack of intimacy and intercourse or the choices which to engage in said activities.  3. It is inappropriate to compare these two things as it does not and cannot produce an objective outcome that is not purely based on anecdotal evidence.    As a former incel I'll also state that I've been in both scenarios at this point in my life and I can't say that one was worse than the other. It really sucked when I couldn't find a partner and I felt like I was subhuman garbage because I was incapable of experiencing the fantasy that was romance. It was also incredibly terrible when I was being used as a stepping stone to another relationship and my only worth was based on how much I could do in the bedroom especially as I thought those people were my friends. It literally felt like I was a toy and in both cases I felt subhuman and I don't think it's appropriate even having experienced them to compare them to one another other.",

I know it can be tempting to go back to an old community, but it's honestly good you left it, and for that and all your efforts, I hope you are proud of yourself, because you should.  It's not easy to have a better image of ourselves. As some comments said, what we see in movies, on TV, whatever, are people that are way above average. And it's hard to get out of that mindset that we absolutely need to be like them.  I don't know your age, but here's my piece anyway : when I was 22/23, I met a guy. We bonded through playing Dark Souls 3 coop, he was discovering the game. We talked, he was sweet, and I was definitely falling for him. He showed me a picture of himself, and he was very chubby. I was head over heels for him. I was in my first long term relationship with him, for two years. My best friend asked me what I found in him (well, she's a lesbian, so it's hard for her to see anything in a man ahah). And what I always answered was \"I know he's not Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. But I don't care. To me, he's better.\"  I don't believe in women settling down when they are older because they want to be slutty. Don't get me wrong, some definitely do, and I have nothing against that as long as they are clear about it with partners. But I don't think the majority of women are like that. My friends always dated to have a long term relationship. Having a one night stand ? Sure. But they always dated because they felt something for the other, they wanted to build something with them, even if they knew it might just be for just a few years. It was never out of loneliness or just to play with anyone.  I am biased here, because I don't really believe in the whole \"settling down\" in the \"guess I'm old now, I'll just fond someone and will stick with them for life\" way tbh",

I'm pretty perplexed by your idea of ''generally considered unattractive'' though. I'm nothing special, but if I look at the three relationships I had in my life...  One was pretty fat and had alopecia (loss of hair), nothing special about their jaw, nice skin, teeth and a face I found pretty. They were very short also. Personality: artistic and introverted, though pretty funny.  The other was tall, nice hair, a lot of acne, not fat but a big gut. ''Good'' jaw you would say. Nice face. Personality: very confident and outgoing. More of a geek (math, computers).  The last one: normal height, nice hair, smaller jawline, bad teeth, very thin, an especially high voice (was made fun of a lot in high school for it), cute face.

The messages are often just asking for nudes and if it even gets to the point where they meet up it’s usually with the intention of a one night stand. Rarely does it progress to a relationship. So this isn’t a good experiment to figure out if it’s easier for women to find partners. Do they have easier access to sex? Sure. Partners? Maybe, but this experiment can’t tell you that. Also it sounds like you might have been using Tinder which is notorious for being difficult to create a genuine match. If you are seriously looking for a relationship try Hinge instead. It’s a slower process for matches because more people are serious about making a connection. It also gives you an opportunity to showcase your personality.",
